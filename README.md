# GenEveBot


#### Overview

GenEveBot leverages the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to integrate powerful language models for enhanced functionality. Upon uploading data, the bot segments it into chunks, applies advanced embeddings, and stores them in a Vector Database (VectorDB). This approach optimizes retrieval efficiency and facilitates comprehensive document management.
